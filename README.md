# Book-Store-Web-App
This is the Book Store Web Application I made in the Masters program at Virginia Tech: CS 5244 Web Application Development.

This is the code I used for the final submittal of the book store ecommerce web application. In this application, I used the Vue Framework with HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front end, Java and JDBC for the business side/ api's, and MySQL for the database.
